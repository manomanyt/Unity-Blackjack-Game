# Unity-Blackjack-Game
A videogame made in Unity for the Fontys University.

Project Introduction:
For our first project at the Fontys University we had to make a game that included a social problem. For my game I wanted to include addiction as the social problem. The game is about you gambling all of your family's money away and dealing with the effects of either winning or losing. The game is very simple and it was made in the span of 4 weeks. I thought it would be a good first project to add to my repository and it would be a good learning experience.

This repository contains:
- A WebGL build for the game in a ZIP file.
- A ZIP file that contains all of the game's art.
- All scripts that were written for this project in C#.
