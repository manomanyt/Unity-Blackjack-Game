# Unity-Blackjack-Game
A videogame made in Unity for the Fontys University.

Project Introduction:
For our first project at the Fontys University we had to make a game that included a social problem. For my game I wanted to include addiction as the social problem. The game is about you gambling all of your family's money away and dealing with the effects of either winning or losing. The game is very simple and it was made in the span of 4 weeks. I thought it would be a good first project to add to my repository and it would be a good learning experience.

This repository contains:
- A WebGL build for the game in a ZIP file.
- A ZIP file that contains all of the game's art.
- All scripts that were written for this project in C#.

What has this project taught me?
- Create a professional IT product within a timeframe.
- Preparing, researching for the project.
- Reflecting on the project.
- Learning how to use Unity.
- Learning the basics of C#.
- Learning how to use AI as a teacher and not as a solution.
- Asking for feedback on the project from fellow students and teachers.

Conclusion:
This project was a great introduction to ICT and it caters to my hobby's and my interests and I wanted to share this on here and learn a bit on how to use GitHub. I have learned allot and i am curious to see where this study and ICT as a whole will take me.

DISCLAIMER!!!
The project started in September so this repository is uploaded at a later date due to the fact that I didn't know anything about GitHub untill a friend introduced me last week. Showing progress in this repository is hard because every comits are made in the same day but the project was in fact made in 4 weeks during my school time.
